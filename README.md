# DataScienceBootCamp
For Civic Hacking project quick start onboarding

## Python Quick Start

### Anaconda

* Why Anaconda?  Other tools are just as good but this is one that we like and want to try for this bootcamp.  This is a convenient way to get the basic environment set up to install the key libraries and it creates a launcher.  

### JuPyter

* It is a "REPL" (Read, Eval, Print, Loop) notebook for doing interactive development. 

### Python NumPy

### Pandas 

* Panda is like "R" in that it creates "data frames" but it's build on NumPy
